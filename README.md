# WebUI + SQL
An example of how to work with SQL on an embedded Web UI

# Description
* Opens an Internet Explorer window with a personalized UI and shows the contents of an SQL database
* New values can added on the fly through the interface, which will immediately be shown on the UI
* The example itself was written in C++, but the base was originally written in C and here it shows how both can be integrated on the same project
* The code is based on the IWebBrowser2 class, which as of 2021 can be considered deprecated, but still works fine
